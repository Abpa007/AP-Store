- Login as admin
- Add/Edit/Delete Products

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Ap-Store.git
cd Ap-Store
````

---

### 2️⃣ Setup Admin Backend

```bash
cd admin-panel/backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your MongoDB URI>
JWT_SECRET=<your JWT secret key>
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 3️⃣ Setup Admin Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

### 4️⃣ Setup Customer Store

```bash
cd ../../../store
npm install
npm start
```

---

## ⚙️ Deployment

- **Admin Backend:** Render / Railway / Heroku
- **Admin Frontend:** Vercel / Netlify
- **Store Frontend:** Vercel / Netlify

> Make sure to configure environment variables in the hosting platform securely.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- `.env` files must **not** be committed (add them to `.gitignore`).
- Keep JWT secrets and Mongo URIs safe.
- Use separate `.env` for development and production.
- Protect admin routes with authorization middleware.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Payment gateway (Stripe / Razorpay)
- Order tracking & invoice generation
- Product reviews & star ratings
- Admin dashboard analytics

### ✅ What You Need to Do:

- Replace:
  - `<your-username>` → your GitHub username
  - `<your MongoDB URI>` → don't expose; just write placeholder
  - `<your JWT secret key>` → same
  - `[Your Email Here]` and `[Your LinkedIn Here]` → optional

- Make sure `.env` is ignored:
```

# .gitignore

.env

```

Let me know if you want:
- Admin panel login preview
- Deployed site URL section
- GitHub repo summary (bio + tags)
- Auto-deployment workflow (CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Render)

All the best with Ap-Store! 💼🛒
